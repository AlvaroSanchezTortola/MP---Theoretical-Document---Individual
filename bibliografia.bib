abstract = {The machine learning field, which can be briefly defined as enabling computers make successful predictions using past experiences, has exhibited an impressive development recently with the help of the rapid increase in the storage capacity and processing power of computers. Together with many other disciplines, machine learning methods have been widely employed in bioinformatics. The difficulties and cost of biological analyses have led to the development of sophisticated machine learning approaches for this application area. In this chapter, we first review the fundamental concepts of machine learning such as feature assessment, unsupervised versus supervised learning and types of classification. Then, we point out the main issues of designing machine learning experiments and their performance evaluation. Finally, we introduce some supervised learning methods.},

abstract = {There are lots of classification and feature extraction algorithms in the field of brain computer interface. It is significant to use optimal classification algorithm and fewer features to implement a fast and accurate brain computer interface system. In this paper, we evaluate the performances of five classical classifiers in different aspects including classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Kappa and computational time in low-dimensional feature vectors extracted from EEG signals. For our experiments we used BCI Competition 2003 Data Set III and Data Set Ia. Classifiers were compared on 61 different datasets which were created with a combination of extracted features. When classifiers were ranked based on the average values of performance metrics, we conclude that the NB and the SVM classifiers are shown to be good candidates for pattern classifi- cation for low dimensional feature vectors. On the other hand, it can obviously mention that decision tree classifier provides the worst performance. We believe that this paper has a significant contribution in the field of classifier for brain computer interface appli- cations.},

abstract = {Patterns of brain activity during deception have recently been characterized with fMRI on the multi-subject average group level. The clinical value of fMRI in lie detection will be determined by the ability to detect deception in individual subjects, rather than group averages. High-dimensional non-linear pattern classification methods applied to functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) images were used to discriminate between the spatial patterns of brain activity associated with lie and truth. In 22 participants performing a forced-choice deception task, 99{\%} of the true and false responses were discriminated correctly. Predictive accuracy, assessed by cross-validation in participants not included in training, was 88{\%}. The results demonstrate the potential of non-linear machine learning techniques in lie detection and other possible clinical applications of fMRI in individual subjects, and indicate that accurate clinical tests could be based on measurements of brain function with fMRI. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The Support Vector Machine is a theoretically superior machine learning methodology with great results in classification of high- dimensional datasets and has been found competitive with the best machine learning algorithms. In the past, SVMs have been tested and evaluated only as pixel-based image classifiers. Moving from pixel-based techniques towards object-based representation, the dimensions of remote sensing imagery feature space increases significantly. This results increasing complexity of the classification process, and causes problems to traditional sample-based classification schemes. The objective of this study was to evaluate SVMs for effectiveness and prospects for object-based image classification as a modern computational intelligence method. An SVM approach for multi-class classification was followed, based on primitive image objects produces by a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm. The segmentation algorithm produced primitive objects of variable sizes and shapes. Then, a feature selection step took place in order to provide the features for classification which involved spectral, texture and shape information. Contextual information was not used. Following the feature selection step, a module integrating an SVM classifier and the segmentation algorithm was developed in C++ and based on XML technology for feature representation. For training the SVM, sample image objects, derived from the segmentation procedure were used. The SVM procedure produced the final object classification results which were compared to the Nearest Neighbor classifier results, of the eCognition software, and were found satisfactory. The SVM approach seems very promising for Object Based Image Analysis and future work will focus on the integration SVM classifiers with rule-based classifiers},

The first part explores ancient methods recorded circa 1000 B.C. (e.g., God's judgment in Europe).

This is followed by an outline of more modern-day approaches such as FACS (Facial Action Coding System), functional MRI, and Brain Fingerprinting. Finally, after the familiarization with the historical development of techniques for lie detection, we discuss the scope for new initiatives not only in the area of designing new methods, but also for the research into lie detection itself, such as its motives and regulatory issues related to deception.},

Recently, newer methods of recording electromagnetic signals from the brain show promise in permitting the detection of deception or truth telling. Some are even being promoted as more accurate than conventional polygraphy. While the new technologies raise issues of personal privacy, acceptable forensic application, and other social issues, the focus of this paper is the technical limitations of the developing technology. Those limitations include the measurement validity of the new technologies, which remains largely unknown. Another set of questions pertains to the psychological paradigms used to model or constrain the target behavior. Finally, there is little standardization in the field, and the vulnerability of the techniques to countermeasures is unknown. Premature application of these technologies outside of research settings should be resisted, and the social conversation about the appropriate parameters of its civil, forensic, and security use should begin.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Reductions in exposure to environmental tobacco smoke have been shown to attenuate the risk of cardiovascular disease. We examined whether the 2003 implementation of a comprehensive smoking ban in New York State was associated with reduced hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction and stroke, beyond the effect of moderate, local and statewide smoking restrictions, and independent of secular trends. METHODS: We analyzed trends in county-level, age-adjusted, monthly hospital admission rates for acute myocardial infarction and stroke from 1995 to 2004 to identify any association between admission rates and implementation of the smoking ban. We used regression models to adjust for the effects of pre-existing smoking restrictions, seasonal trends in admissions, differences across counties, and secular trends. RESULTS: In 2004, there were 3813 fewer hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction than would have been expected in the absence of the comprehensive smoking ban. Direct health care cost savings of {\$}56 million were realized in 2004. There was no reduction in the number of admissions for stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admission rates for acute myocardial infarction were reduced by 8{\%} as a result of a comprehensive smoking ban in New York State after we controlled for other relevant factors. Comprehensive smoking bans constitute a simple, effective intervention to substantially improve the public's health},

METHODS: Text books on LR and research articles employing LR as main statistical analysis were reviewed. Twenty-three articles published between 2010 and 2011 in the Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing were analyzed for proper use and reporting of LR models. RESULTS: Logistic regression from basic concepts such as odds, odds ratio, logit transformation and logistic curve, assumption, fitting, reporting and interpreting to cautions were presented. Substantial shortcomings were found in both use of LR and reporting of results. For many studies, sample size was not sufficiently large to call into question the accuracy of the regression model. Additionally, only one study reported validation analysis. CONCLUSION: Nursing researchers need to pay greater attention to guidelines concerning the use and reporting of LR models.},
